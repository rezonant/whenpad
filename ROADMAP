x Add + new = 00:12:34 under 'Total' to indicate how much time will be recorded after the current entry is saved
- Add 'Timeline' and 'Now' buttons above the Time Entries which immediately reorder your time entries to chrono or 
  reverse chrono sort order
x Find a new name for it, as clockr is taken (Whenpad)
- reset the tag of the current post immediately upon hitting 'Finish Entry'
- Make a new widget for the Modify WHICH ACCEPTS MOUSE SCROLL
  * Instead of saying Modify: it should actually show + or - based on whether the value is positive or negative in a nice way, so
    visually it looks like:
    [Start] [Finish] 00 : 12 : 34     + 00:00:00 [Go] 
x Rearrange the UI.
  * Move Start and Finish to in front of the clock and relabel to 'Start' and 'Finish'. 
  * Introduce a new CSS class for the Start/Finish buttons which is half as long (or so)
  * The 'Merge' button should go down under Tags, along with the new 'Timeline' and 'Now' buttons.
  * Total should move down to the Time Entries section as well.
  * Let's move the Tag control all the way back next to Note, but with just a bit of space as in:
    
    00  : 12  :  34
    ▼ Note          Tag: [clockr ▼]
    
    This will help the user to remember to change it properly when he switches focuses.
