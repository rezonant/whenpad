whenpad
=======

Whenpad is an HTML 5 application which does nothing but track your time. It is slightly oriented toward professional uses, but could be used for any sort of 
time tracking purpose.

You can start a timer, which will count ahead until you enter a Note and click 'Save' to make a time entry out of the current timer. At this point the clock resets.
Whenpad is not designed for you to be its slave. If you forget to update your Whenpad, you can use the 'Alter' controls to change what the current timer reads out,
and you can change the time or note associated with any previous time entry. You can even reorder them. Whenpad tracks actual start/end timestamps for each entry
in case you confuse yourself.

You can make as many time entries as you want. Whenpad makes this easy to manage by letting you associate 'Tags' with your entries. Whenpad will automatically tally
up the time for each of the tags which are used in your current set of time entries. You can also merge any set of time entries. Whenpad will use the earliest Start Date
and the latest End Date for each entry. It will also merge all the notes of the selected time entries.

Whenpad is also set up to be useful over multiple days. Time entries are automatically separated into tabs per day.  

You can use Whenpad from any device, as the application is fully responsive.
